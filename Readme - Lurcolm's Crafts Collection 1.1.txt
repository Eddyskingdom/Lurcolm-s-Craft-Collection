DESCRIPTION:

Alright... The boneworking holds a lot of faith on honour. YOu need to be honest with yourself with especially
 boneworking. 

For installation, it's rather easy. You first take your original "diy_glossary" and "biy_glossary"
files, then rename them to "ORIGINAL diy/biy_Glossary". That way, if something fucks up you can
just replace the modified file with the original ones.

Afterwards, unzip the Truetile.zip folder for all the images, then just... Mass copy and past. Simple as that.

I'd strongly recommend making a few characters to just dick around with the recipes,or alternatively
 just peak through the mod files

Please, email me any bug reports or things that don't work on: Jan.l.h.carelse@gmail.com


CHANGELOG 1.1:

-Added a wooden maul as a crafting option
-Added a small flail as a crafting option, with changing the way flails are made by replacing the leather with rope
-Dicked around with the stats of the bows you can make. Essentially I wanted A hunting bow, a longbow
 and a northern bow to have stats that make them shine in their own departments. Otherwise there'd be no point 
 in making them all craftable. As of this moment, the bows act on a give/take relationship. Longbows are the most 
 accurate, but do the least damage. Hunting bows are the middle ground and Northern Bows are the most innacurate,
 but do the most damage. Please be honourable and retiller your starting bows and any bows you find with these
 things
-Added being able to craft a crossbow
