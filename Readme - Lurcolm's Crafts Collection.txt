Alright... The boneworking holds a lot of faith on honour. YOu need to be honest with yourself with especially boneworking. 

For installation, it's rather easy. You first take your original "diy_glossary" and "biy_glossary"
files, then rename them to "ORIGINAL diy/biy_Glossary". That way, if something fucks up you can
just replace the modified file with the original ones.

Then just... Mass copy and past. Simple as that.
